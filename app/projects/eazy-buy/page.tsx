                <img src="../image/category.png" className="rounded-md border border-zinc-200" />

                <h3>User Cart</h3>
                <p>The userâ€™s cart view shows products that have been added to the cart. The total item count and total price are each dynamically updated using AJAX. When checkout is initiated the PHP PayPal SDK is used the facilitate the transaction.</p>

                <h3>Orders</h3>
                <p>A transaction history is stored in the database to track which products a user has purchased. The unique order id, item name, product quantity, and order total are displayed for each order and sorted by the last order date.</p>
                <img src="../image/orders.png" className="rounded-md border border-zinc-200" />

                <h3>Product Reviews</h3>
                <p>For any given product in an order, the user may leave a review. This review is dynamically rendered for others to view under the summary view of the product.</p>
                <img src="../image/review.png" className="rounded-md border border-zinc-200" />

                <h3>Product Summary</h3>
                <p>When a product is selected by the user, the corresponding details are dynamically retrieved from the database. Reviews that were made by customers who have already purchased the item are also displayed below the product.</p>
                <img src="../image/product.png" className="rounded-md border border-zinc-200" />

                <h3>PayPal SDK</h3>
                <p>The PHP PayPal SDK is used to process and execute a transaction on checkout. A summary is also provided of each item that the user had in their cart upon initiating checkout. In order to securely complete each transaction, the processing and execution are each handled on the server.</p>
                <img src="../image/checkout.png" className="rounded-md border border-zinc-200" />

                <h3>User Registration System</h3>
                <p>The user registration system requires a user to login before completing a transaction. When a new account is created, the details are inserted into appropriate database table. Otherwise, if the user signs in, credentials are validated against data already stored in the database. Passwords that are stored in the database are encrypted using the bcrypt algorithm.</p>
